- 👋 Hi, I’m @juanfonsecasolis-gl
- 👀 I’m interested in automation, math applied to quality control and assurance, and digital audio processing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code test frameworks on JS (like Cypress), Docker, Selenium, and test programming patterns.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to the use of digital audio processing on testing.
